An embedded project using a Raspberry Pi Pico to strobe LEDs to make it look like water droplets are floating in mid-air.
Heavily inspired by [isaac879's RGB Time Fountain](https://github.com/isaac879/RGB-Time-Fountain)

## Firmware
Firmware for the cyw43 chip can be found [here](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/cyw43-firmware). It should be placed in the `cyw43-firmware` folder to make the program compile.
